This plugin sorts imports strictly in alphabetical order by first letter of import statement. It's based on [sort-imports](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/sort-imports) rule but it has a few differences.

It makes your imports look like this:

```js
import 'alice'
import 'bob'
import * as Ant from 'ant'
import * as Bear from 'bear'
import Adam from 'adam'
import { B as A, C } from 'letters'
import David from 'david'
import { E, F as H } from 'other-letters'
```

## Parameters

This plugin has the following parameters:

-   <b>allowSeparatedGroups</b> (default: <i>false</i>) - When true the rule checks the sorting of import declaration statements only for those that appear on consecutive lines.
    In other words, a blank line or a comment line or line with any other statement after an import declaration statement will reset the sorting of import declaration statements.
